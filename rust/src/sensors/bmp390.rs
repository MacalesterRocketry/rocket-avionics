//! BMP390 barometer (I²C). Skeleton.
//!
//! Target config (matches BMP3XX usage in C++):
//!   - temperature oversampling  8×
//!   - pressure oversampling     4×
//!   - IIR filter coeff          3
//!   - output data rate          100 Hz
//!
//! Driver strategy: the `bmp388` crate works for the BMP390 (registers are
//! identical between BMP388 and BMP390; only the pressure range differs).
//! Altitude is computed from pressure with the standard barometric formula
//! using SEALEVELPRESSURE_HPA = 1013.25 — same constant as the C++ source.
